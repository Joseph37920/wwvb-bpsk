wwvb-bpsk
=========

This stuff is a collections of data about WWVB and the new BPSK data transmission.
The documents detail the construction of a WWVB frequency standard using minimal RF
components and the MF10 "switched capacitor filters" as the IF. The IF frequency
is at 2500 Hz. The device is controlled by a PIC P18F2620 and has a display for
the current time (UT and Date) and outputs for 1Mhz and 2Mhz frequencies controlled
by the WWVB carrier. There is jitter in the outputs but when compared with a
local Rubidum Frequency standared the output signal have a good long term
accuracy.
Photos and schematics as well as documents about the circuits and lots of
waveform photos are provided. The program will have to be compiled using
the MicroChip MPLab IDE, its a free download for both the Windows and
Linux system. I use Linux so the schematics (originals not the JPG outputs)
are in the Electronic Schematic editor that runs under Linux.
