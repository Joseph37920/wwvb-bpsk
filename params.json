  "body": "wwvb-bpsk\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThis stuff is a collections of data about WWVB and the new BPSK data transmission.\r\nThe documents detail the construction of a WWVB frequency standard using minimal RF\r\ncomponents and the MF10 \"switched capacitor filters\" as the IF. The IF frequency\r\nis at 2500 Hz. The device is controlled by a PIC P18F2620 and has a display for\r\nthe current time (UT and Date) and outputs for 1Mhz and 2Mhz frequencies controlled\r\nby the WWVB carrier. There is jitter in the outputs but when compared with a\r\nlocal Rubidum Frequency standard the output signal have a good long term\r\naccuracy.\r\nPhotos and schematics as well as documents about the circuits and lots of\r\nwaveform photos are provided. The program will have to be compiled using\r\nthe MicroChip MPLab IDE, its a free download for both the Windows and\r\nLinux system. I use Linux so the schematics (originals not the JPG outputs)\r\nare in the Electronic Schematic editor that runs under Linux.\r\n",
